## Synapse Dashboard Demo

Future Fibres is hiring a front end JavaScript developer to build interactive dashboards to turn data collected from our IoT platform in a compelling and useful product. Outlined in this document is an exercise that will help demonstrate some of the skills required for the position.

### Main features
- Create a small web application with React or Vue. This application should look like a modern web application and be responsive to screen size.
- Connect to the open weather API to receive the weather from the previous 5 days. Keys for this are available in the free tier.
- Display this data using a modern graphing library.
- Provide some menus that will query the api set for different cities.
- Display a few items of data â€“ for example show temp, wind speed, wind direction and humidity using widget or charts of your choosing

### Bonus features
- Ideally the data visualization would be interactive i.e. you can highlight certain data point and read the value or a section of data to zoom in and see more resolution.
- Connect to firebase and provide an authentication flow and user accounts. Store a small amount of data in fire store to retain the state of the app
- Unit tests
- Multiple pages

### Notes
- Feel free to use a UI library like bootstrap.. but no full templates!
- D3 or VX are good options / example of the graphs likely to be used in
production
- JavaScript or Typescript OK
- Structure the application as you would for a larger production application
